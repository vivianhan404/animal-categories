When learning a new category, they only need to see a few examples to understand what kinds of things that category encompasses and to generalize to other instances of that category. In this study, we want to explore how children use definitions and examples to learn about very broad categories (e.g. 'mammals').",
      "procedures": "This study takes about 15 minutes. During this study your child will learn about 4 different animal categories. For each trial, you will see a short video definition and a few examples of animals in a specific category, then answer a question regarding the category.",
      "risk_statement": "There are no expected risks if you participate in the study.",
      "payment": "After you finish the study, we will email you a $5 Amazon gift card (via a code that can be entered online) within five days to thank you for your time. To be eligible for the gift card your child must be in the age range for this study, you need to submit a valid consent statement, and we need to see that there is a child with you. But we will send a gift card even if you do not finish the whole study or we are not able to use your child's data! There are no other direct benefits to you or your child from participating, but we hope you will enjoy the experience.",

            "text": "Thank you for participating in this study! Your child saw examples of concepts (e.g., examples of 'mammals' or 'reptiles'). However, there are better and worse examples to show a child if you want to teach them a new concept. For example, if you are trying to teach a toddler what a 'dog' is, showing them a Dalmatian, a Golden Retriever, a Beagle, and a Husky Dog is more useful than showing the four different Dalmatians. Here we were interested in parents' intuitions about the relationship between the examples and the concept, and their reaction to the misleading examples. In particular, we were interested in whether parents would spontaneously 'correct' the misleading examples by providing the child with additional examples. Thus, although the study was set up to look like an experiment on children's learning, we were actually interested in analyzing, not the children's performance on the questions asked, but adult behavior during the teaching portion of the tasks."

          {
            "text": "There were no right or wrong responses in this study. Parents were told to let the child respond on their own and not to interfere with any aspect of the experiment. If you let the study run without any deviation from the experiment design, that was a perfectly reasonable decision, and indeed what we'd asked you to do. However, in many studies, some parents do nonetheless 'interfere' with the design in one way or another. These participants are typically excluded from the analysis, but in this case, parental interference was the focus of the research. We believed parents might be more likely to 'interfere' with the study and point out additional examples of the concept in the trials where we gave the children misleading examples (e.g., showing only pets as examples of mammals, or only snakes as reptiles) than in the trials where we gave children representative examples (e.g., showing a snake, an iguana, a crocodile and a turtle as examples of reptiles). Investigating parents' responses to both 'good' and 'bad' instances of teaching can help us understand people's intuitive understanding of how the representativeness of examples affects learners' inferences. It can also help us understand the contexts in which parents might interfere with developmental studies, not because the parents are non-compliant, but because they are trying to support their child’s learning."

Please note that you have the right to withdraw your data from the study if you wish. We'll be emailing you a $5 Amazon gift card. This should arrive in your inbox within the next week after we confirm that a child is with you in the video recording and check that your child is in the age range for this study. If you don't hear from us by then, feel free to reach out! Please don't hesitate to contact us at vivhan@mit.edu if you have any additional questions or feedback!"
