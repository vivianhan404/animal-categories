          "text": "Thank you so much for participating in this study \nThis study was motivated by this paper by Tenembaum and Xu: https://web.mit.edu/cocosci/archive/Papers/cogsci00_FINAL.pdf . They showed that both adults and children use examples shown to gauge how broad the concept is. Thus, there are better and worse sets example to show to teach a concept. For example, showing three images of dalmatians is a terrible way to explain what a ‘dog’ is because these examples will make someone think that all dogs have black and white spots. Instead, a more representative set of examples would be a poodle, a golden retriever, and a husky. \nIn this study, we wanted to know if parents could recognize this and go out of their way to turn a “bad” set of examples into a “better” one to help their children learn a concept. When analyzing this study, we will measure whether the parent (you) chose to point out non-highlighted animals of the category during the teaching phase of the trial. \nThank you again for participating! We'll be emailing you a $5 Amazon gift card - this should arrive in your inbox within the next week after we confirm that a child is with you in the video recording and check that your child is in the age range for this study. If you don't hear from us by then, feel free to reach out! Please don’t hesitate to contact me at shengyiw@mit.edu if you have any additional questions or feedback!",
