At the end of the session, you will choose a privacy level for your webcam recordings - private, scientific, or publicity (more details will be provided at the exit survey at the end of the experiment). You will also have the option to withdraw your recordings. If you do, only your consent recording will be kept and all other recordings will be deleted."

But we will send a gift card even if you do not finish the whole study or we are not able to use your child's data!

            "text": "Thank you for participating in this study! Your child saw examples of concepts (e.g., examples of 'mammals' or 'reptiles'). However, there are better and worse examples to show a child if you want to teach them a new concept. For example, if you are trying to teach a toddler what a 'dog' is, showing them a Dalmatian, a Golden Retriever, a Beagle, and a Husky Dog is more useful than showing the four different Dalmatians. Here we were interested in parents' intuitions about the relationship between the examples and the concept, and their reaction to the misleading examples. In particular, we were interested in whether parents would spontaneously 'correct' the misleading examples by providing the child with additional examples. Thus, although the study was set up to look like an experiment on children's learning, we were actually interested in analyzing, not the children's performance on the questions asked, but adult behavior during the teaching portion of the tasks."

          {
            "text": "There were no right or wrong responses in this study. Parents were told to let the child respond on their own and not to interfere with any aspect of the experiment. If you let the study run without any deviation from the experiment design, that was a perfectly reasonable decision, and indeed what we'd asked you to do. However, in many studies, some parents do nonetheless 'interfere' with the design in one way or another. These participants are typically excluded from the analysis, but in this case, parental interference was the focus of the research. We believed parents might be more likely to 'interfere' with the study and point out additional examples of the concept in the trials where we gave the children misleading examples (e.g., showing only pets as examples of mammals, or only snakes as reptiles) than in the trials where we gave children representative examples (e.g., showing a snake, an iguana, a crocodile and a turtle as examples of reptiles). Investigating parents' responses to both 'good' and 'bad' instances of teaching can help us understand people's intuitive understanding of how the representativeness of examples affects learners' inferences. It can also help us understand the contexts in which parents might interfere with developmental studies, not because the parents are non-compliant, but because they are trying to support their child’s learning."
